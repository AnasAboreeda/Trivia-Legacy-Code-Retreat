# Legacy Code Retreat in Javascript

This is my version of legacy code retreat in Javascript. The code base is taken from [here](https://github.com/jbrains/trivia). You can follow the steps I used just by following the commits.

## Test with node.js

- Install the jasmine-node plugin from https://github.com/mhevery/jasmine-node

```ShellSession
npm install jasmine-node -g
```

- And execute:

```ShellSession
jasmine-node .
```

Any test source matching the pattern *.spec.js will be executed.
