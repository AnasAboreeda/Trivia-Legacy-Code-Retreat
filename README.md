# Legacy Code Retreat in Javascript

This is my version of legacy code retreat in Javascript. The code base is taken from [here](https://github.com/jbrains/trivia). You can follow the steps I used just by following the commits.

## Test with node.js

- First you need to run `npm install` inside game directory

- Then execute:

```ShellSession
jasmine-node .
```

Any test source matching the pattern *.spec.js will be executed.
